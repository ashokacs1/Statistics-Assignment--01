    "1. Nominal Level:\n",
    "   - Description: At the nominal level, data is categorized into distinct, non-ordered categories or labels. These categories have no inherent ranking or numerical significance.\n",
    "   - Example: Types of fruits (e.g., apples, oranges, bananas) are nominal variables. There's no inherent order or ranking among these categories.\n",

    "Understanding the level of measurement is crucial when analyzing data because it dictates the types of statistical analyses and operations that can be appropriately applied to the data.

You collect test scores from a sample of students and use inferential statistics to analyze the data. By testing hypotheses, such as \"Is there a statistically significant difference in test scores between the two teaching methods?\", you can infer whether the new method is likely to have a positive impact on the entire student population.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Median:**\n",
    "   - Definition: The median is the middle value when the data is arranged in ascending or descending order.\n",
    "   - Use: It's the middle point that divides the dataset into two equal halves. The median is less affected by extreme outliers and is useful when the data is not symmetric.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Mode:**\n",
    "   - Definition: The mode is the value that appears most frequently in the dataset.\n",
    "   - Use: It identifies the most common value or category in the dataset, which can be helpful in categorical data or when identifying peaks in a distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Measures of Variability:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Range:**\n",
    "   - Definition: The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the dataset.\n",
    "   - Use: It provides a simple measure of the spread of data, indicating how much the values vary from the minimum to the maximum.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Variance:**\n",
    "   - Definition: Variance measures how each data point deviates from the mean, squares those deviations, and calculates their average.\n",
    "   - Use: It quantifies the overall variability in the dataset. A higher variance indicates greater dispersion.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Standard Deviation:**\n",
    "   - Definition: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance.\n",
    "   - Use: It is a widely used measure to express the spread of data in the same units as the original data. Smaller standard deviations indicate less variation.\n",
    "\n",
    "These measures help to provide a comprehensive description of a dataset. Measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) give insights into the typical values, while measures of variability (range, variance, standard deviation) indicate how much the data points deviate from the central value, helping to understand the data's dispersion and variability."
